# Welcome to TERRAFORM!!!

## Terraform infrastructure Provisioning for AWS.

#### USED and TESTED with:
 - Terraform v0.12.20 and
 - provider.aws v2.49.0


#### Download: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
#### Provider help: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html

#### MANDATORY TASK:
1. Create an EC2 Instance.
2. Create a Group in IAM
3. Create an IAM User
     - Give him programmatic Access and
     - Console Access.
4. Create Password Policy
5. Attach Password Policy to Newly created User and ADD him to the group.
6. Create a Role and attach it to the EC2 Instance
    for example:
        - if we want to provision EC2 Instance then,
        - create ROLE( it should have AmazonEC2FullAccess) and attach it to ec2-instance.
7. Connect to an EC2-instance in AWS using .pem file provided while creating it.
#### Now the user has both programmatic Access as well as Console Access.

#### After connecting to the EC2-Instance, go to the home directory:
```
 sudo su;
 cd;
```
#### download terraform for ubuntu:
```
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.20/terraform_0.12.20_linux_amd64.zip

unzip -v terraform_0.12.20_linux_amd64.zip
```

#### To add to Environment variables
 export PATH=$PATH:/root

#### To check the version
 terraform version

#### Create a directory
 mkdir infraProvision

#### Go to that directory
 cd infraProvision

####  WE can provide AWS Access to Terraform in the following Ways:

 #### AWS account options: ONLY OPTION 4 is RECOMMENDED Approach.

  1. Create IAM User with Programmatic Access and Use 'Access Key ID' and
    'Secret Access key' in 'provider.tf' as shown below.

  #### Sample provider file:
  ```
  -------------------provider.tf------------------------------
      provider "aws" {
      access_key = "uaasdusaQL" #use your 'Access Key ID'
      secret_key = "u9d889su9s9d0" #use your 'Secret Access key'
      region = "ap-south-1" #The Region where you want to provision
      }
  --------------------------------------------------
 ```
  2. Create IAM User with Programmatic Access pass through Environment variables:
    ```
      export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="u9as8u8ADADFS9u89as89ua"  ##use your 'Access Key ID'
      export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="98ASYD8AD99HH9suad0saud9s0" #use your 'Secret Access key'
    ```
  3. Storing it under  ~/.aws/

  4. Attach Admin Roles to Instance (RECOMMENDED)
      - create ROLE( it should have AmazonEC2FullAccess) and attach it to ec2-instance.

#### Create the definition file with .tf extension
 ex: vim 1-create-ec2-instance.tf
 Use the below code in it to create a Single EC2 instance in AWS.
 ```
  --------------1-create-ec2-instance.tf----------------
    resource "aws_instance" "First_demo" {
      #ubuntu-os
      ami = "ami-0620d12a9cf777c87"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"
      key_name= "key-pair" #check for exisiting key in aws ec2-dashboard > network security > key-pair  #key-pair  if already it's present you can use that.

      tags = {
        name = "demoInstance"
      }
    }
  ----------------------------------------------------
 ```
#### To generate and show execution plan
 terraform plan

#### Troubleshooting:

   if the above command doesn't work. Then
   - check whether the logged in user has  programmatic access ?
       - if yes, then check whether the 'provider.tf' has the details?
          - NOTE: provider.tf file should be present in the same working directory.
            #### sample provider file:
      ```   
       -------------------provider.tf-----------------------------
         provider "aws" {
         access_key = "uaasdusaQL" #use your access_key
         secret_key = "u9d889su9s9d0" #use your secret_key
         region = "ap-south-1" #The Region where you want to provision
         }
       ---------------------------------------------------
      ```
      - NOTE:
        - This is NOT A RECOMMENDED approach as it uses keys and
          stores them in the instance.

   - Any Role is attached to the connected EC2 Instance?
      - if not, attach the role.
      - NOTE:
        - If Roles are attached then,
          no need to use 'access_key' and 'secret_key' in 'provider.tf' file.
        - RECOMMENDED Way is to attach Roles.

#### To add plugins and Initialize a Terraform working directory
 terraform init
 
#### To Build the infrastructure plan and start Provisioning infrastructure.
 terraform apply    

#### To Destroy the provisioned infrastructure:
 terraform destroy

#### Terraform GraphViz
 www.graphviz.org
 to visualized tf code as a graph
 apt install graphviz

 terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png

 #### Teraaform inline variables:
  terraform apply -var ami_type='<ami-id>'
